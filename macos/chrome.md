You can capture the screenshot of a specific HTML Element/DOM Node via DevTools. To do this:

Inspect the element you wish to capture.
Open the Command Menu with Cmd + Shift + P / Ctrl + Shift + P.
Type in screenshot within the Command Menu.
You can now capture the screenshot of only the specific element, a viewport screenshot, or a full-page screenshot.
